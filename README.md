# Dungeon-Game
This is a personal project that helped me learn and work with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. If the project turns out well, I might upload it to Steam as a free game for everyone to play and enjoy.

How to Run the Game

To run the game, simply compile and execute the code as you would with any standard Java program. If you encounter any issues, follow these instructions:

Compilation: javac Main_game_file/*.java Game/*.java

Run in GUI Mode: java Main_game_file.DungeonWindow

Note:
The Game and Main_game_file folders are both located inside a main folder also named Main_game_file, as shown in the GitHub repository structure. Also, the game plays music in the background. However, due to the large file size of the music, I couldnâ€™t include it in the GitHub repository.
